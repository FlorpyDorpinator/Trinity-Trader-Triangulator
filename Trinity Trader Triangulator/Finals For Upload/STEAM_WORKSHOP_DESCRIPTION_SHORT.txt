[h1]Trinity Trader Triangulator - IC10 Scripts[/h1]

A sophisticated multi-chip computer system for Stationeers that automatically locates and triangulates trader satellite positions using advanced 4-step matrix mathematics and polynomial angle correction.

[h2]System Overview[/h2]

The Triple T system uses [b]11 IC10 scripts[/b] across [b]9 chip housings[/b] to perform spiral scanning, three-shot triangulation, polynomial angle correction, and real-time status display.

[h2]The Scripts[/h2]

[h3]Core Control[/h3]
[list]
[*][b]TrinitySearch.ic10[/b] - Main controller that orchestrates scanning, triangulation, and user input
[*][b]TrinityOS.ic10[/b] - Operating system with scrolling LED display showing 15 status messages
[/list]

[h3]4-Step Matrix Computer[/h3]
[list]
[*][b]TrinityOne.ic10[/b] - Converts angle measurements to directional vectors using trig calculations
[*][b]TrinityTwo.ic10[/b] - Builds matrix for least-squares triangulation
[*][b]TrinityThree.ic10[/b] - Computes matrix inverse using cofactor calculations
[*][b]TrinityFour.ic10[/b] - Solves for final X, Y, Z coordinates
[/list]

[h3]Angle Correction[/h3]
[list]
[*][b]TrinityAngleSolver.ic10[/b] - Compensates for non-linear dish behavior with piecewise interpolation
[*][b]TrinityPolynomial.ic10[/b] - Forward lookup: converts dish settings to true angles
[*][b]TrinityPolynomial2.ic10[/b] - Inverse lookup: finds dish setting for desired angle
[/list]

[h3]Initialization[/h3]
[list]
[*][b]TrinityOS Stack Loader.ic10[/b] - Preloads 15 display messages (run once)
[*][b]TrinityPolynomial Stack Loader.ic10[/b] - Loads 91-point correction table (run once)
[/list]

[*]Load the 9 operational scripts into their respective chip housings
[*]Connect: satellite dish(es), Logic Dial, "Enter" and "Reset" buttons, 1×3 Console LED (labeled "TrinityOS")
[*]Power on and press Enter to begin scanning
[/olist]

[h2]Usage[/h2]
[list]
[*][b]Enter button:[/b] Start search / Interrogate / Call down
[*][b]Reset button:[/b] Restart system anytime
[*][b]Logic Dial:[/b] Select which trader to triangulate
